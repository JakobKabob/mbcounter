I like to work on my laptop via LTE services, this allows me to work on all my stuff anywhere. But since i'm not rich yet I have to watch my internet usage, and 
since I couldn't find any linux package that did what I wanted, I decided to write my own. Obviously it's a little bare atm but thats bc i have no idea 
how this stuff works yet. A couple updates further down the line and its a proper package downloadable via github. 

**Functionality** 
  - limiting internet usage, deactivating the connection after it crosses a set limit
  - notifying the user through audiovisual media, for instance if the 90% of quota has been crossed. 
  - maybe a nice gui in ncurses, with a filling bar when approaching your own set limit, and colours. 

I'm open to suggestions :)

**status**
psutil doesnt support arm based?
